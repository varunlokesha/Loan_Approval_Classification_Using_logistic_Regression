# Loan Approval Classification Using Logistic Regression

The purpose of the exercise is to effectively code and design a binary classification model using logistic regression to decide whether a person is likely to be approved for a loan. Steps include

•	Performing cleaning operations to prepare data for modelling

•	Use logistic regression algorithm to build a classification model that uses the features within the dataset to perform binary classification. 

•	Interpret the results and comment on the accuracy of the model and discuss whether the model is good or not.

## Data Cleaning & EDA

Null Value Check, Outlier Check, Checking the categorical feature balance/distribution were some of the data cleaning tasks.

For Exploratory Data Analysis, The features were closely studies and various scatterplots were used to understand how the features were correlated.

## Logistic Regression Model

The model was developed by setting up a train and test data with 70-30% split. Scaling/Standardizing, training and fitting was performed to predict output values.

## Conclusion

It can be seen that the main features for building a model to predict the data the main features are Age, Experience, Family, Credit card average, Education, securities account, CD account, online and credit cards are significant. Then the model is trained and tested to produce an accuracy of 96%.
1.	The overall Accuracy of the model is calculated to be 96%.
2.  The Precision value was 0.819.
3.  The AUC value is 0.84
